# Responsive-Theatre

This project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus was to utilize programming languages to build a responsive movie theatre. I started by brainstorming an idea and found inspiration from Coursera and Google. The HTML and CSS were relatively straightforward. I encountered challenges when working with JavaScript, particularly with functions and if statements. Using the console log was crucial for debugging, and I discovered that common mistakes included incorrect naming, missing colons, and minor grammar errors. Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience.
